Types of Statistical Graphics
=============

You are now ready to make your plot! There are many types of statistical graphics that you can choose from to showcase your data. Each type has its benefits, and drawbacks, based on how it combines marks and channels to encode your data. Match the chart type to your data, and not the other way around.

Identify Your Data Type
-------------------

Data can be quantiative or qualitative. Quantitative data is either continuous (numerical data like height and weight), or discrete (constrained values, such as the number of children in a family). Qualitative data can be ordered (categories that have a relationship but no meaningful distance between them, such as movie star ratings), or nominal (categories that have no meaningful order, such as gender).

Now that you've identified the types of the data you want to show in your visualization, explore different chart type options using this nifty tool by [from Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/).





Here's a static, text-heavy overview:

**Single quantitative variables** are plotted to show the frequency distribution of the data. While historgrams are the most common density plots, a single quantiative variable can also be plotted using a rug plot/strip chart, boxplot, or violin plot (described below, where they're most commonly employed).

**Two quantiative variables** can be plotted using a:
* Scatterplot (or dot chart) - each axis encodes the values of a different quantitative variable, and individual data are represented as points (or dots) on the chart.
* Line plot - data points are connected by straight lines. Line-scatter plots are are common for time series or trend data.

**One quantitative + one qualitative variable** are suitable for a:
* Bar chart - bars represent the amount of data in different categories of a variable. One axis encodes the frequencies of the quantitative data, and the other axis the categories of the qualitative data.
* Lollipop chart - a barplot with the bar transformed to a line and a dot.
* Boxplot - shows the median, quartiles, and bounds of your data.
* Violin plot - in essence a boxplot that also shows the distribution of the quantiative variable.
* Multiple density plot - two density plots (or histograms) overlaid on the same axes.
* Pie chart, which uses relative frequencies to show how large each category is in relation to the whole. *Pie charts are grudgingly listed here because you will see them in the wild, but resist the temptation to use them!* Based on our visual perception, pie charts are inherently problematic because they encode values as visual attributes. Pie charts encode data as the area of each slice, as well as the angle that it forms in the center of the pie, making it difficult to easily perceive and compare differences. Almost any other chart type is better than a pie chart.
* Word cloud - these eyecatching visualizations display a list of words with their font size corresponding to their importance. But, they're not very useful and often distort reality. For example, long words will look more prominent just because they have more letters and cover more area - our eyes don't intuitively parse out word height from length. Wordclouds also require a huge sample size.

**Two qualitative variables** can be plotted using a moasic plot, side-by-side barplots, or line plots.


Relationships between more than two variables are conveyed using a chart type above with a combination of channels (for example, plotting sympols) and/or juxtaposed panels. 

Other complex plot types you may encounter:
* bubble plots
* radar plots / star chart - plot one or more qualitative values over multiple quantitative values, where each variable has its own axis and all axes are joined at the center of the figure. A bar or lollipop plot is often a better alternative. [Check out some great examples at data-to-viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/spider.html).
* stem and leaf plots - basically a table

Using a Functional Approach
-------------------------

Not sure which chart type to use? Ask ask yourself:

* What are the tasks you want the visual to support?
   * Showing how values compare to each other?
   * Showing how the data are distributed?
   * Showing how the data are composed?
   * Showing how values relate to one another?
* What specific visual best supports those tasks?
* What do we expect people to do in their visual queries?
* How can we support the queries to be fast(er)?
* What visual queries are easily executed?
* How can we use graphical marks and channels to efficiently serve those queries?
 
Create your visual, and run through the list again keeping in mind the principles of visual perception, effectiveness and efficiency. Does it meet your needs? If not, try a different type. **Graphing, like writing, requires continuous editing.**

For example, if you want to enable comparing values and their relationships, use a bar or dot plot. When you want to make accurate comparisons, try a chart with lines or bars sitting on a single axis.
