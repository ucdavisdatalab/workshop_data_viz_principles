Graphical Elements of a Plot
=============

Marks and channels are the building blocks of all data visualizations. **Marks** are the grpahical elements in a plot - the bars, lines, and points. **Channels** are the attributes of these marks - their position, shape, size, color, etc. - that are controlled by the data and can be encoded to indicate their values or meaning. 

How can we use marks and channels effectively to tell our data story? To address that we have to first understand how we process visual information.
