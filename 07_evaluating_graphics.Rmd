Evaluating Graphics: Expressiveness and Effectiveness
=============

The last steps in creating a chart is iteration. Munzner has a useful framework for evaluating graphics based on the principoles of expressiveness and effectiveness.

Expressive graphics
-----------------------

The expressiveness of the visual encoding of a graphic should "show all of, and only, the attributes of the data" (Munzner). When this fails, a chart is not only suboptimal and confusing, it can be incorrect and misleading.

Here are some examples of how a chart can fail the expressiveness principle:

*  The encoding implies ordering when there actually is none.
*  The encoding mis-orders a variable. 

Effective graphics
---------------------

Effectiveness addresses how accurately can the interpreter of the chart decode the encodings within it and derive accurate knowledge? The importance of an attribute should match the salience of its channel.

Examples: bar chart compared to a bubble chart. Area is difficult to compare. Bars are lines placed on acommon baseline, making these comparisons easier.
