# Overview {-}

Objectives
----------------------------

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:

* Explain when, and why, to use a data visualization
* Describe common features of “good” data visualizations
* Identify principles of visual perception and aesthetics that can be used to
  make effective and expressive plots
* Compare the features and utility of various plot types
* Critically review a plot to meet responsible data science standards
* Know where to go for more resources on making accessible and equitable data
  visualizations

Prerequisites
-------------

This workshop is intended for researchers who are actively working with data.
It covers material in a tool-agnostic way, with the intent that researchers may
use it to improve their visualizations regardless of the software they use.
While we will not be covering how to create plots with graphical software, the
DataLab offers other workshops on this topic:

* [Data Visualization in R][dvr]
* [Dynamic Data Visualization][ddv]

[dvr]: https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_r_data_viz
[ddv]: https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_dynamic_data_viz/chapters/index.html

Additionally, our [research toolkits][] offer other suggestions for creating
visualizations in the data science domain.

About This Reader
-----------------

This reader provides additional background information as a reference for
learners to better understand and practice the concepts that instructors will
introduce during the live workshop session. To that end, the reader will
persist at this URL after the workshop.
